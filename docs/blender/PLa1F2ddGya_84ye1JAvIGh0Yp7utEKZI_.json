Recently a project has been underway to change the mesh system significantly again, using principles from data-oriented design. Two years and more than 15 thousand lines of code later, that process is nearly finished. The idea is that data should be stored separately and generically, with the same simple data types that any Blender user or developer can use, as part of the attribute system.\n\nWas it worth it? How much smaller can files be, and how much less memory do we use? Is Blender faster? How many bugs did the changes cause? This talk will answer those questions, and get into the history and some of the principles of the attribute system.\n\n\"Attributes: Making Geometry Smaller and Faster\" by Hans Goudey --\n\nLearn more about Blender Conference 2023 at https://conference.blender.org/2023/ \n\n#BCON23 #b3d","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pabcq2obH1s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pabcq2obH1s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pabcq2obH1s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pabcq2obH1s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pabcq2obH1s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_84ye1JAvIGh0Yp7utEKZI_","position":23,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pabcq2obH1s"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"pabcq2obH1s","videoPublishedAt":"2023-10-26T17:03:17Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"upzIYrprbqUB9Z5RCYFWOs72qa0","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfODR5ZTFKQXZJR2gwWXA3dXRFS1pJXy42MTI4Njc2QjM1RjU1MjlG","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-26T16:44:00Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Simulation Nodes: Making Nodes Come to Life","description":"An in-depth look at the newly added simulation capabilities of Geometry Nodes in Blender.\n\nYou will learn the principles on how the simulation nodes work, get an insight into the value they add to Geometry Nodes and learn to create a full simulation setup for a custom melting effect.\n\nGet the files at bit.ly/3ZXircm\n\n\"Simulation Nodes: Making Nodes Come to Life\" by Simon Thommes --\n\nLearn more about Blender Conference 2023 at https://conference.blender.org/2023/ \n\n#BCON23 #b3d","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2NRCcsX9Xo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2NRCcsX9Xo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2NRCcsX9Xo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2NRCcsX9Xo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H2NRCcsX9Xo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_84ye1JAvIGh0Yp7utEKZI_","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"H2NRCcsX9Xo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"H2NRCcsX9Xo","videoPublishedAt":"2023-10-26T17:35:02Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fUoVu_zCn3ZJhqEMWC5efxw9zuQ","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfODR5ZTFKQXZJR2gwWXA3dXRFS1pJXy4zRDBDOEZDOUM0MDY5NEEz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-26T16:30:49Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"A New Animation System","description":"The Animation & Rigging module will show their work of the past year on the Animation 2025 project, and present the exciting features and improvements coming to Blender 4.0 and beyond.\n\n\"A New Animation System\" by dr.

It represents a medium that holds significance, historical context, and even prehistory, rooted in media remediation, visual studies, and cultures.\n\nLike any medium or tool, Blender has meaning, as cultural codes are embedded within all technologies. For instance, every render engine or 3D modeling tool carries the past, quite literally embedding the history of painting rules and technologies, drawing techniques, perspective, and even physics through optics.\n\nAs artists based in Canada and working individually or collectively in the field of contemporary and digital arts, Gauthier, St-Pierre and Latulippe utilize Blender as a central tool. In this presentation, they will first provide an overview of their previous artistic projects, encompassing installation art, videos, 3D printed sculptures, and prints, which will establish the foundation for their artistic approaches and aesthetics.\n\nThe overview will include visual examples of our artwork showcased in gallery spaces and within the context of visual or digital arts. Starting from these previous works, they will delve into a specific research and creation project undertaken by the authors that revolves around the concept of culture and meaning embedded in technologies.\n\nThis project, entitled \"The Presbyopic Camera, The Myopic Object,\" artistically explores new viewpoints using Blender while revisiting the history of perspective and optics encoded within 3D software.

Created in 2017, the studio already produced three unique series in its very first year, achieving the platform's highest viewership.\n\nTraditionally, our productions involved hand-drawn work using Adobe Animate. However, a few years ago, we embarked on a remarkable project titled 'Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix,' a top-tier series produced in collaboration with Ubisoft's Film and Television. The series is set to debut in early October 2023 on Netflix (check out the trailer here: https://youtu.be/LgAUYJ_gglg).\n\nGiven the vast scale and high-quality demands of this show, especially for our small-scale studio, we made the strategic decision to integrate Blender into our workflow. By using Blender for vehicles and weapons, we enabled our 2D animators to focus on character animation instead of hard surface 2D elements.\n\nIn parallel to this major project, a dedicated team began working on a 2D/3D hybrid workflow, aiming to enhance the quality of future productions. This endeavor led to the establishment of our Research and Development (R&D) department, specializing in innovative hybrid techniques based on Blender for backgrounds and 2D character animations.\n\nOur presentation will focus on sharing the success of our seamless 2D to 3D transition, along with the exploration of techniques that effectively blend both animation worlds. We would like to\npresent behind-the-scenes glimpses of the making of Captain Laserhawk and illustrate how this project led to the development of a new production mindset, increased productivity, and the integration of Blender in our R&D department. We look forward to sharing our journey and contributing to the Blender community's collective knowledge.\n\n\"Bobbypills: An Adult Animation studios journey to CG\" by Yannick Castaing, Erika Grace Strada --\n\nLearn more about Blender Conference 2023 at https://conference.blender.org/2023/ \n\n#BCON23 #b3d","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnQNNxOdb48/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnQNNxOdb48/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnQNNxOdb48/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnQNNxOdb48/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnQNNxOdb48/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_84ye1JAvIGh0Yp7utEKZI_","position":37,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nnQNNxOdb48"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"nnQNNxOdb48","videoPublishedAt":"2023-10-27T12:10:53Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"_jdvW8dDzp8MCwmwJlRiCSEPafE","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfODR5ZTFKQXZJR2gwWXA3dXRFS1pJXy41RTNBREYwMkI5QzU3RkY2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-27T12:03:30Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Handling Custom Data in glTF Files with Exporter/Importer Plugins","description":"Blender is arguably one of the best tools for developing a wide variety of assets, and glTF is often a good export format for real-time graphics applications given how much of it supports and how extensible it is.

Resulting models are employed in biophysically plausible simulations, allowing us to study structure-function relationships at cellular level. \n\nRelying on the modeling toolsets and advanced capabilities, we designed two sister plugins that are domain-specific and widely used by the neuroscientific community. NeuroMorphoVis and VessMorphoVis are primarily used by neuroscientists and neuroanatomists to visualize, analyze, repair and to mesh morphological models of the NGV ensemble including neurons, astrocytes and large networks of cerebral vasculature. We will present a few solid use cases to demonstrate the significant role of Blender in the context of scientific visualization, mainly in our mission to digitally reconstruct and simulate the mouse brain.\n\n\"Leveraging Blender to model and visualize the neuro-glia-vascular (NGV) ensemble\" by Marwan Abdellah --\n\nLearn more about Blender Conference 2023 at https://conference.blender.org/2023/ \n\n#BCON23 #b3d","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjGyzkCcGw8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjGyzkCcGw8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjGyzkCcGw8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjGyzkCcGw8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjGyzkCcGw8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_84ye1JAvIGh0Yp7utEKZI_","position":47,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"MjGyzkCcGw8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"MjGyzkCcGw8","videoPublishedAt":"2023-10-27T15:34:30Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"CFRPpvG6xR2roqGaX-VavRVmqas","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfODR5ZTFKQXZJR2gwWXA3dXRFS1pJXy43NERCMDIzQzFBMERCMEE3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-27T15:03:36Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Rigging With Geometry Nodes on \"Wing It!\"","description":"Geometry Nodes was used in a variety of ways to rig characters and props on the latest open movie, Wing It!

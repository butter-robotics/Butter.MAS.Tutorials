This would ease the restrictions that artists are faced with over what sorts of meshes are 3D printable, to be more in line with familiar art related best practice.\n\nThis talk includes an overview of other tools in the Voxelpress project, and discusses better integration with Blender to provide a seamless 3D printing experience to the end user.\n\nAbout Aeva Palecek\n\nAeva Palecek is a Software Engineer working for Aleph Objects, Inc., a Libre Hardware company that sells free as in freedom reprap-style 3D printers. She volunteers to teach python programming at women's outreach events, contributed 3D model visualization support to GNU MediaGoblin, and is working on a project called Voxelpress, which is an effort to improve the state of Free Software 3D printing tools and infrastructure.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSbcaHtI2nI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSbcaHtI2nI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSbcaHtI2nI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSbcaHtI2nI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSbcaHtI2nI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":1,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bSbcaHtI2nI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"bSbcaHtI2nI","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-25T10:12:21Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Zfcmkz5PVudZw4m0HRtQgmnlAs4","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Ton Roosendaal -

Blender can be used for 3D printing and is now shipped with tools to help with that, but it can be used for CNC machining too, either by exporting the model or directly by using BlenderCAM. Combining of Blender with those tools allows you to explore a much wider variety of designs, some of them impossible in any other way. Add the endless possibilities of Python and you can play without limit. We will see some examples of 3D printing and 3 axis CNC machining done with Blender and open hardware (Ultimaker 3D printer and Shapeoko CNC) and explore the possibilities and some of the problems one can face during the process. Most of those examples will be in the architectural field, but we will see some mechanical parts and more artistic concepts too.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OB2QbN-YDCM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OB2QbN-YDCM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OB2QbN-YDCM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OB2QbN-YDCM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OB2QbN-YDCM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":7,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"OB2QbN-YDCM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"OB2QbN-YDCM","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-30T13:01:11Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"RsMV55YCIlvpRHOitpwz7cHqIXU","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC45NDk1REZENzhEMzU5MDQz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Francesco Siddi and Pablo Vazquez - Blender Network: first year report, future plans","description":"Francesco and Pablo will report on the status of the Blender Network, illustrate future plans and have feedback session.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fl9epdY08E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fl9epdY08E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fl9epdY08E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fl9epdY08E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fl9epdY08E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":8,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"1fl9epdY08E"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"1fl9epdY08E","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-30T13:03:47Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qtO8Zx00ueZPYavjBc3mFxB739Y","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Olivier Boisard - From Blender Projects to Mobile Devices","description":"This case study presents the experience developed working with professionals of astronautics on the design of space prospective projects: solar sails, space elevator, space cities, space solar power stations, asteroid mining, space debris collectors...\n\nBlender was the design tool used for all these projects -- some illustrations and animations are online on my website dedicated to space prospective at www.e-archipel.net.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HI-udcfm0x0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HI-udcfm0x0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HI-udcfm0x0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HI-udcfm0x0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HI-udcfm0x0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":9,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HI-udcfm0x0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"HI-udcfm0x0","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-27T14:58:02Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"k4b5SVaUkwBTWZdzEh3KSkq1fcU","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Silvano Imboden - A production pipeline for Cultural Heritage movies","description":"Computer graphics productions for Cultural Heritage purposes suffer usually from limited budgets.

The availability of Cookie Flex Rig characters cut significantly down the time of production, enabling to concentrate only on adapting them to the philological needs of museum curators. Improved production pipeline and ready-made character have been mixed with less modeling and more laser data acquisitions, helped in this choice by new released open-source 1.3.2 Meshlab tool and its better integration within Blender.\n\nThe presentation also covers our experience in setting up our render-farm, planning, driving and supervising the production, and managing people collaboration in a geographically distributed team. While coming from a specific field of application, our experience share many points with a general low-budget production, so we hope the presentation could be of a general interest.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2ZoWveaOgE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2ZoWveaOgE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2ZoWveaOgE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2ZoWveaOgE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2ZoWveaOgE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"r2ZoWveaOgE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"r2ZoWveaOgE","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-27T14:46:33Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"STosC3_y_Wb7f3ZL-_oentnOJ8c","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC5EMEEwRUY5M0RDRTU3NDJC","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Daniele De Luca - Computer-aided Pizza Designer with Blender","description":"Pizza Designer is a project committed by Italpizza, a leading manufacturer operating world-wide, developed at Cineca and entirely based on Blender.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESiod5ZmFw0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESiod5ZmFw0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESiod5ZmFw0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESiod5ZmFw0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESiod5ZmFw0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":11,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ESiod5ZmFw0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"ESiod5ZmFw0","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-27T14:30:37Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NEBKifu7YAPtIFC7d7eZ6zepg2Q","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC45ODRDNTg0QjA4NkFBNkQy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Helmut Satzger - How to render a Blender movie on a supercomputer","description":"I work at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre in Munich, Germany, and have access to SuperMUC, currently still the 9th fastest computer in the world, with more than 150,000 processor cores, 300TByte RAM and 10 PByte harddisk - and it runs the standard Blender from blender.org.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WngjpjHVHAY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WngjpjHVHAY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WngjpjHVHAY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WngjpjHVHAY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WngjpjHVHAY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":12,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WngjpjHVHAY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"WngjpjHVHAY","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-27T14:29:40Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HAy930Ix0AXiA3nUxhYQ-Sg8MaI","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC4zMDg5MkQ5MEVDMEM1NTg2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Waqas Abdul Majeed - Luke's Escape (Animated Short)","description":"I would like to present the experience and work of International Team working together, all 19 members for the first time on creating a short film which will be sent out to different festivals around the globe.\n\nProject Luke's Escape has Members from different countries, time-zone, cultures and languages.

To compare different algorithms, the computer vision community needs common benchmarks, i.e. datasets of images or videos with additional information, such as segmentations or per-pixel motion. Creating such datasets is hard and time consuming. Therefore, they are often small, simplistic (e.g. contain only static scenes), or, in case of synthetic datasets, lack visual realism.\n\nIn contrast, the Sintel production data contains large amounts of 3D data that is more complex and visually more realistic than existing synthetic datasets. However, the structure of this data is determined by the artists, and does not necessarily correspond to the representations used by computer vision research to reconstruct the structure of a 3D scene. For example, \"objects\" in Blender scenes often do not correspond to real objects.\n\nThis talk shows how we modified Blender and Sintel to extract data and convert it to appropriate representations, making it usable for computer vision benchmarks. We present three scenarios: optical flow (per-pixel motion estimation), segmentation, and depth estimation, all of which are of great interest to the computer vision community.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZNy6baU9tAI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZNy6baU9tAI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZNy6baU9tAI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZNy6baU9tAI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZNy6baU9tAI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":21,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZNy6baU9tAI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"ZNy6baU9tAI","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-26T15:06:52Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"tzv-__ts92m1DLJoC_e0saP6BeI","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC4zRjM0MkVCRTg0MkYyQTM0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"José Maria Rebello de Andrade - Ptolmus: fast and expressive animation","description":"A man and an unknown creature talk in a cave. That is the setup of the animated film Ptolmus, entirely done with Open Source software (Blender, Gimp, LMMS and Audacity), that served as proof of concept of Josemaria RRA's master's degree dissertation called \"Optimization of facial rigs for low budget production animated series\".\n\nThe main goal of this research was to study and propose new facial rigging techniques that could permit organic and expressive movements with little work, in order to create good animation as fast as possible. The necessity to give the rig limitations and cut down the number of controllers and animation channels became clear. It was important to carry a bibliographic review about facial anatomy and expressions (e.g., Ekman, P. & Friesen, W.V., 2003), and to analyze other rigs and animated films. An exploratory study of the face expressions (involving direct observation of real persons) and a consultancy session with Nathan Vegdahl were other sources of knowledge.\n\nThis presentation will also show the rig used to create facial expressions, focusing mainly on the author's original ideas for the designed rig. Positive and negative aspects of the original ideas for the rig will be discussed.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4M3nMl7nwI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4M3nMl7nwI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4M3nMl7nwI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4M3nMl7nwI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4M3nMl7nwI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":22,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"G4M3nMl7nwI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"G4M3nMl7nwI","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-26T15:10:41Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yAyab6hTJilG1OFPFf28iWsAQG8","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC45NzUwQkI1M0UxNThBMkU0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:01:51Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Jorge Ribeiro - Switching from 2D animation to 3D using Blender","description":"As a 2D freelance animator, I always felt the necessity to evolve and to keep up with the market.

Blender helped me a lot by visualizing and transforming this data. In this workshop I will talk about (and show) what these useful techniques have helped me to achieve. We'll focus on:\n\n    Creating objects in Blender through Python API calls.\n    This will simply start by selecting the Scripting layout, utilizing the auto-completion of the interactive console to explore the available operators, data, etc.\n    Restructuring those calls into an operator.\n    After showing the console, we'll move to the text editor and create an operator. This will make it easier to apply the same code in different situations.\n    Extending the Blender UI to call your operators.\n    A text file is nice, a proper Blender extension is better. Especially when it extends the Blender UI and things get easy to use.\n    Loading data from a SQLite database to populate your UI.\n    This gives us the ability to load & visualize data from outside Blender, turning Blender into a data visualization and exploration tool.\n\nThe workshop will be aimed at people with at least a basic understanding of object-oriented programming, preferably with Python.\n\nAbout Sybren A. Stüvel\n\nSybren obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science in Amsterdam and a M.Sc. Game & Media Technology in Utrecht.

After mixing studying with working in the IT industry, he is now a full-time PhD student at the Universiteit Utrecht, specializing in the animation of large, dense crowds of virtual humans. In his research he uses Blender as an analysis tool, working with motion capture files (BVH) and generating content based on the output of his research software. He has used Blender for 10 years, and Python for 8 years, and now creates his own extensions to aid in his research.\n\nSybren is also drummer of the Amsterdam-based ska & reggae band The Soundabout, and edited and color graded their video clip Kort Dag (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPXqv-I5bEs) in Blender.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wt8WdSvaRms/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wt8WdSvaRms/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wt8WdSvaRms/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wt8WdSvaRms/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wt8WdSvaRms/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8MnhVxPL9Z6B2AL2XTeigT","position":32,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Wt8WdSvaRms"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"Wt8WdSvaRms","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-27T14:44:16Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Mf1EuJZzOwzCkuwlSg_SQ_73Hsg","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOE1uaFZ4UEw5WjZCMkFMMlhUZWlnVC5CMEQ2Mjk5NTc3NDZFRUNB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T23:02:14Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Graham Knott - Case Study Presentation: Analysing the brain with Blender","description":"We are researching the fine structure of neurons in the brain, and in particular how they change through the ageing process.

These simulators often utilize virtual reality hardware, such as special haptic devices to provide feedback and 3D input, as well as stereoscopic rendering on various display systems. Obviously, the simulation and rendering has to rely on high quality 3D models. In this presentation we want to demonstrate how Blender can be used as a powerful tool in the development of medical simulators. In a case study, we provide insight into the development of a human heart surgery simulator and how Blender has been utilized in this process. The workflow from medical imaging CT and MRI datasets, the modeling steps in Blender, the export and the integration into the simulator will be described.\n\nAbout Sebastian Ullrich\n\nFounded in 2004 in Stockholm, SenseGraphics represents outstanding experience in medical virtual reality simulation based on its open source platform H3D API. Photo realistic anatomical 3D models created in Blender, impressive Visual Effects and an immersive Haptic Feedback take medical simulation to the next level. Successful products, research projects and implementations speak for themselves.\n\nThe presenter of this talk is a senior software engineer and expert in medical simulation at SenseGraphics. He received his M.Sc. (2005) and Ph.D. (2011) degrees in computer science from RWTH Aachen University.

Eventually, it might be an alternative to video recording, unlocking anonymous expression for deaf individuals on the Internet using their primary language. Such a tool would also put sign language studies back into the hands of the deaf by allowing them to populate large corpus of animation data -- potentially a very valuable research material for the advancement of Sign Language linguistics.\n\nWe elected Blender as development platform for fast prototyping and evaluation of innovative User Interfaces and Interaction Paradigms. In this paper, we present the results that we have achieved so far. They mainly focus on the design of a User Interface assisted by novel input devices.

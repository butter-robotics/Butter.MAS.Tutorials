Whether you’re into cars, cinematic rendering, or pure creativity — this is a love letter to what Blender makes possible.\n\n–\n\nLearn more about Blender Conference 2025 at https://conference.blender.org/2025/\n\n#b3d #BCON25","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAHkR6c5aTU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAHkR6c5aTU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAHkR6c5aTU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAHkR6c5aTU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAHkR6c5aTU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8u-HEvmfCVuS_OImW8HaLd","position":44,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HAHkR6c5aTU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"HAHkR6c5aTU","videoPublishedAt":"2025-09-18T17:10:52Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"zGuZS_sVtnPTGQnJtM8CBrwXgFI","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOHUtSEV2bWZDVnVTX09JbVc4SGFMZC5EQkE3RTJCQTJEQkFBQTcz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2025-09-18T17:09:33Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Blender at Volkswagen Group — Blender Conference 2025","description":"\"Blender at Volkswagen Group\" by Ali Varol, Alina Schubert at Blender Conference 2025\n\nThis presentation is about how Blender is currently used within the Volkswagen Group and where we see its future potential.

Unlike traditional anime workflows using Blender, this approach doesn't rely on Grease Pencil, shader tricks, or hand-drawn effects. Instead, I reimagine the aesthetic through purely 3D techniques using creative workarounds within Eevee's limits. In this talk, I will share how I recreated Akira's iconic backgrounds, lessons learned, and my future goals.\n\n–\n\nLearn more about Blender Conference 2025 at https://conference.blender.org/2025/\n\n#b3d #BCON25","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FcEVgl369YQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FcEVgl369YQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FcEVgl369YQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FcEVgl369YQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FcEVgl369YQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya_8u-HEvmfCVuS_OImW8HaLd","position":48,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FcEVgl369YQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"FcEVgl369YQ","videoPublishedAt":"2025-09-18T17:51:30Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"D0iVfcEVhqeoiYfTS4Nm1Wfw4wQ","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfOHUtSEV2bWZDVnVTX09JbVc4SGFMZC5FQUY2Qzk4RUFDN0ZFRkZF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2025-09-18T17:41:52Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"The Sculpting, Modeling and Node tools - key players in the game art pipe — Blender Conference 2025","description":"\"The Sculpting, Modeling and Node tools - key players in the game art pipeline\" by Leonardo Betancur Díaz at Blender Conference 2025\n\nThis talk is designed to showcase how Blender’s sculpting, modeling and other integrated tools can be effectively used for game asset creation, with a strong focus on Environment, Prop art and character  concepting.

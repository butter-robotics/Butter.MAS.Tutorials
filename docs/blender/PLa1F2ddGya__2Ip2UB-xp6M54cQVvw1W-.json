From artistic tools, to sanity check, through shared libraries, add-on management and support, this is how a small team can work remotely with Blender.\n\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 10:00 at the studio.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pF5QVw0nHi0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pF5QVw0nHi0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pF5QVw0nHi0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pF5QVw0nHi0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pF5QVw0nHi0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":32,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pF5QVw0nHi0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"pF5QVw0nHi0","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T10:08:08Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2wx8Q2FTJ-RUxhwCBFS_I3dGfBM","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS41MzY4MzcwOUFFRUU3QzEx","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T10:28:34Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Creating animations with point clouds","description":"In this 1-hour session, Midge will use a point cloud scanned at BCON or during the session to create a funky abstract animation loop to celebrate the return to our in-person conference.\n\nHe'll guide you through importing and manipulating point clouds in Blender, all the way to rendering and comping your end result.\n\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 11:00 at the classroom.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIbBhyJodZY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIbBhyJodZY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIbBhyJodZY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIbBhyJodZY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIbBhyJodZY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":33,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lIbBhyJodZY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"lIbBhyJodZY","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T10:33:20Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"eZ1ZUygqGL6SK8UKItr85IItsXE","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS4yQjZFRkExQjFGODk3RUFD","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T10:51:36Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"The Secrets of Photorealism","description":"Discover the science to making believable photorealism, and why Toy Story 4 gets everything right.\n\n\"The Secrets of Photorealism\" by Andrew Price @blenderguru \nBlender Conference 2022\n\n#BCON22 #b3d","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z8AAX-ENWvQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z8AAX-ENWvQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z8AAX-ENWvQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z8AAX-ENWvQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z8AAX-ENWvQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":34,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Z8AAX-ENWvQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"Z8AAX-ENWvQ","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T10:56:07Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HzNEeCf1W2oLOFYtUrdH84CNhkk","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS4yQUJFNUVCMzVDNjcxRTlF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T11:24:27Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Video mapping for live open-air operas","description":"Imagine you have to create content for a video mapping (video projection on a building) for a live performed open air opera.

However, Grease Pencil objects have started to turn heads at 2D animation studios. Not only are Grease Pencil objects powerful in their own right, they're capable of taking advantage of a true 3D environment. And because it's in Blender, there's the additional benefits of being open source—particularly the lack of vendor lock-in.\n\nThe challenge has been in integrating Blender in the standard 2D animation workflow. There's no mechanism for getting 2D vector animation data from typical 2D animation software into or out of Blender. That's changing now thanks to Swiffle, an import/export add-on for Blender, focused on the SWF format (yes, SWF).\n\nThis talk will go into the reasons and benefits of choosing SWF for interchange and the challenge of supporting that format in Blender. Included in the talk will be a demonstration of the add-on in its current state along with a discussion of next steps for the add-on and Grease Pencil objects.\n\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 11:00 at the studio.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BscbGzwiK0o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BscbGzwiK0o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BscbGzwiK0o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BscbGzwiK0o/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BscbGzwiK0o/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":36,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BscbGzwiK0o"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"BscbGzwiK0o","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T11:55:54Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"UXNpueubi-nPpjo7dfgFnzbSLRo","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS41RTNBREYwMkI5QzU3RkY2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T11:55:24Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Sprite Fright: production notes","description":"Looking back at Sprite Fright with the Blender Studio team.\n\nhttps://studio.blender.org/\n\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 12:00 at the studio.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZUouFi2DaI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZUouFi2DaI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZUouFi2DaI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZUouFi2DaI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZUouFi2DaI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":37,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-ZUouFi2DaI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"-ZUouFi2DaI","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T12:03:07Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fo3jbFe6PMXHJ1g086qjM8r6A-8","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS5ENjI1QUI0MDI5NEQzODFE","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T12:01:30Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Using geometry nodes for vehicle concept art","description":"In this presentation Daniel will show how he uses geometry nodes to generate designs for vehicles and spaceships in his work as a concept artist.

This part will include a fast-and-precise solution for picking a material within a large list, and a method to do reversible color mapping, both released as free open-source add-ons.\nThen, she will present a method to map and animate grease pencil strokes in a 2D deformable grid, and a triangulation algorithm to convert grease pencil strokes into fair and regular meshes.\n\n\"Grease Pencil tools for animation productions\" by Amelie Fondevilla\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 14:00 at the studio.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pAyVGTX92mo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pAyVGTX92mo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pAyVGTX92mo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pAyVGTX92mo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pAyVGTX92mo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":43,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pAyVGTX92mo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"pAyVGTX92mo","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T13:00:43Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"S0uqeyjwgMjWvjPG9Hlv7fcyltg","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS43NERCMDIzQzFBMERCMEE3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T13:03:06Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Live animation show","description":"Rik will guide you through the jungle of keys, curves and constraints to discover the true essence of the illusion of life!\n\n\"Live animation show\" by Rik Schutte\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 13:30 at the classroom.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jLkc4EgHWj8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jLkc4EgHWj8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jLkc4EgHWj8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jLkc4EgHWj8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jLkc4EgHWj8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":44,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jLkc4EgHWj8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"jLkc4EgHWj8","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T13:12:17Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2mWiiweMkENK-iFMLBVzYGdLhJo","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS5GNjAwN0Y0QTFGOTVDMEMy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T13:23:42Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"From CG artist to storyteller","description":"A comedic presentation detailing how Hollowpixel went from making adverts for colostomy bags, to creating pilot episodes for their own original cartoon series.\n\nA whistle stop tour of the many trials and tribulations of going from a jobbing freelancer to running a startup studio telling their own stories.\n\nVisuals will include sneak peeks from their soon to be released pilot episodes of UNGAMELAND and CODELINGS, as well as shots from their short VFX heavy film Dragons.\n\n\"From CG artist to storyteller\" by Chris McFall\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 14:30 at the theater.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7QF7K1qQifk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7QF7K1qQifk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7QF7K1qQifk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7QF7K1qQifk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7QF7K1qQifk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":45,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7QF7K1qQifk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"7QF7K1qQifk","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T13:32:36Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fOdnHQgkgJ5eKCQzMRpLxPAZmeg","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS5EODgyNjY4MzA3QzY5RTkx","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-30T14:13:17Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Blender Conference 2022 -

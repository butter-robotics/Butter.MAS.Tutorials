This session will give a high-level overview of the concepts behind path guiding, how it is integrated into Cycles using Intel’s Open PGL library, and, more importantly, how artists can use this new technique to generate even more beautiful images. We demonstrate the advantages of path guiding on a set of different types of scenes and will give some advice on when path guiding can be helpful and not, as well as what artists need to consider when using it.\n\nDiscover all Intel@BCON content (sessions, demos, tech blogs and more) on https://create.intel.com/blender\n\n\"Follow the light: Introducing path guiding in Cycles\" by Sebastian Herholz\nBlender Conference 2022\n2022-10-28 13:00 at the attic.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BS1JLbNqGxI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BS1JLbNqGxI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BS1JLbNqGxI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BS1JLbNqGxI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BS1JLbNqGxI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BS1JLbNqGxI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"BS1JLbNqGxI","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T12:18:58Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"CxgFWfoUlS1PrEc2_11qxElkg6o","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS5EODgyNjY4MzA3QzY5RTkx","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-30T14:13:17Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Blender Conference 2022 - Day 1 Recap","description":"An impression of the first day of BCON22 in Amsterdam!\n\nSupport Blender development: https://fund.blender.org\n\nDownload Blender Experimental builds: https://blender.org/experimental\n\n█████████████████████████████████\n\nFollow Blender:\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/blender\n* Instagram: https://instagram.com/blender.official\n* YouTube: https://youtube.com/BlenderFoundation\n* Facebook: https://facebook.com/YourOwn3DSoftware\n\n█████████████████████████████████\n\nFollow Blender Development:\n* Blog: https://code.blender.org\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/BlenderDev","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1_EI_TWBxk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1_EI_TWBxk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1_EI_TWBxk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1_EI_TWBxk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1_EI_TWBxk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Blender","playlistId":"PLa1F2ddGya__2Ip2UB-xp6M54cQVvw1W-","position":25,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"w1_EI_TWBxk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Blender","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"w1_EI_TWBxk","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-28T13:47:21Z"},"status":{"privacyStatus":"public"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Sk3eQ3PqMWVrtfZ2CBQ_BwDhgFo","id":"UExhMUYyZGRHeWFfXzJJcDJVQi14cDZNNTRjUVZ2dzFXLS45NzUwQkI1M0UxNThBMkU0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-27T13:34:36Z","channelId":"UCSMOQeBJ2RAnuFungnQOxLg","title":"Lighting in animated film productions","description":"Andy's first pro gig as a Blender artist was Elephants Dream in 2006;
